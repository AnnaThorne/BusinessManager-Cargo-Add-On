How to fix issues
- IMPORTANT! Before dm me "it doesn't work" please try to adjust settings, don't share your screen on discord and reduce your in-game resolution.
- If you often get stuck in the warehouse menu or don't get the auto-resupply, chose a slower loop speed, your connection or pc is to laggy.
PS : there is an option to restart your game faster than usual in Settings.
